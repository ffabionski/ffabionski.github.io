# About Me 👨🏻‍💻

Hello! I'm Fabio, currently pursuing a master's degree in Computer Science at Università degli Studi di Udine. I recently completed my bachelor's degree in Computer Science with top honors 🎓, and I'm eager to continue learning and growing in the field.

I'm particularly interested in exploring how **security** can be effectively implemented in modern systems. For my bachelor thesis, I had the opportunity to work with technologies like **Open Policy Agent (OPA)** and **Rego**, using them to improve access control in microservices architectures by providing custom state management to enhance decision-making in dynamic systems.

I enjoy learning about new technologies and applying my programming skills to real-world challenges.

**Key Interests:**
- Formal Methods 📝
- Logics 🧠
- Model Checking 🔍
- Cybersecurity 🔒
- Artificial Intelligence 👨🏻‍💻

# Guitar Career 🎸

Outside of my academic life, I'm passionate about music 🎶 and have been playing the guitar for many years. It's something I deeply enjoy and try to balance with my technical pursuits. Over the years, I've performed at several events and honed my skills in various musical styles.

My guitar journey has been deeply rewarding, providing a creative balance to my technical pursuits. I love sharing my passion for music, whether through performances or simply enjoying time with the instrument.

I play in an acoustic duo, **Two Notes**, where we explore a wide range of genres and styles. You can check out us and our performances on [Two Notes' Instagram page](https://www.instagram.com/twonotes.duo/){:target="_blank"}.

I also serve on the board of directors for **Sound Promotion**, the music school in my hometown, where we strive to nurture local musical talent. You can check out more about our activities on [Sound Promotion's Instagram page](https://www.instagram.com/_soundpromotion_/){:target="_blank"}.
